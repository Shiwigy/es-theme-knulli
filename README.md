# es-theme-knulli
## FEATURES
- Designed entirely for Knulli
- Unlike other ES themes, texts are made more readable and images are more visible on small screens
- Aimed to be as simple and fast as possible. For this reason, it has been simplified considerably from the es-theme-basic on which it is based. The size of the theme has been reduced by 2/3
- Instead of specifying separate parameters for high and low resolutions, fixed parameters were used directly, making the theme both faster and less resource consuming
