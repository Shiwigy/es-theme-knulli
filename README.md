# es-theme-knulli
## FEATURES
- Designed entirely for Knulli
- Unlike other ES themes, texts are made more readable and images are more visible on small screens
- Aimed to be as simple and fast as possible. For this reason, it has been simplified considerably from the es-theme-basic on which it is based. The size of the theme has been reduced by 2/3
- Instead of specifying separate parameters for high and low resolutions, fixed parameters were used directly, making the theme both faster and less resource consuming
- Unlike many ES themes, the clock is displayed accurately on small screen devices
- Unlike many ES themes, the problem of text overlapping in the menus has been minimized
- Menu and navigation sounds available
- Added the ability to display only the battery percentage and hide the battery bar, which is not available in ES Settings
- Knulli, Batocera and Rocknix colorsets are available. This makes the interface look more integrated with the system used
- There is a feature to change and disable splashscreen. You can manually select any of the Knulli, Batocera or Rocknix images. When set to automatic, the splash screen automatically changes according to the colorset setting. When disabled, the text is centered and becomes larger
- Added feature to automatically change the grid view according to the screen resolution on HDMI connections. This will allow you to see more games during HDMI connection. The grid setting must be automatic for this to work
- Added some Knulli specific assets and features, such as the Emulators folder and its system image
- Added ability to hide help bar completely from ES settings
- The theme file structure has been made easier and more understandable for other users and developers
- You can view the theme version information in the theme settings
