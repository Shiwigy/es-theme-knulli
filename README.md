# es-theme-knulli
Community theme developed without arrogance...

## FEATURES
- Designed entirely for Knulli
- Unlike other ES themes, texts are made more readable and images are more visible on small screens
- Aimed to be as simple and fast as possible. For this reason, it has been simplified considerably from the es-theme-basic on which it is based. The size of the theme has been reduced by 2/3
- Instead of specifying separate parameters for high and low resolutions, fixed parameters were used directly, making the theme both faster and less resource consuming
- Unlike many ES themes, the clock is displayed accurately on small screen devices
- Unlike many ES themes, the problem of text overlapping in the menus has been minimized

When set to automatic, the splash screen automatically changes according to the colorset setting. When disabled, the text is centered and becomes larger

## VERSIONING
With the addition of the beta branch, the versioning system has been changed since v2.3.x to ensure that etk_tool works smoothly and beta testers can update and provide feedback more easily.  

Now, from the version information in the form of vX.Y.Z; X represents major updates, Y represents minor new additions and bug fixes. Z is unimportant for non-beta testers. So don't worry about Z appearing as x in the changelog or elsewhere.  

Both Emulation Station's own theme store and etk_tool will already download the most up-to-date theme for you.  

## BECOME BETA TESTER
The theme is constantly updated and new features are added. If you want to try new features before the official store version or without waiting for a custom firmware update, you can become a beta tester for free.  

To do this, you need to share the 32-digit code in the ```userdata/system/machine-id``` file with the developer via the ```OD-Commander``` application in the ```TOOLS``` collection on your device. Then you can automatically update beta versions with the ```ETK Tool``` application.
